# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an intelligent email indexing and filtering system that integrates with Ashoka University email accounts (@ashoka.edu.in). The system continuously indexes emails, learns from user preferences about email importance, and uses an LLM to automatically filter and present only important emails to the user. The system maintains incremental indexing to handle new emails efficiently without full re-indexing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Ashoka University user, I want to authenticate with my official email address, so that only authorized university personnel can access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL only accept email addresses ending in @ashoka.edu.in
2. WHEN an invalid email domain is provided THEN the system SHALL reject the authentication and display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a valid @ashoka.edu.in email is provided THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth authentication with the email provider
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's authentication tokens securely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to index all my emails initially, so that I have a complete searchable database of my email history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first connects their email account THEN the system SHALL perform a complete indexing of all existing emails
2. WHEN indexing emails THEN the system SHALL extract and store metadata including sender, recipient, subject, date, and content
3. WHEN indexing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators to the user
4. WHEN indexing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log the errors and continue processing remaining emails
5. WHEN initial indexing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user and enable email filtering functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to continuously index new emails, so that my email database stays current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new emails arrive THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and index them within 5 minutes
2. WHEN performing incremental indexing THEN the system SHALL only process emails that haven't been indexed previously
3. WHEN incremental indexing fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before logging an error
4. WHEN the system is offline THEN it SHALL resume incremental indexing when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN indexing new emails THEN the system SHALL maintain the same metadata extraction as initial indexing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to teach the LLM what constitutes an important email for me, so that the system can learn my preferences and filter accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing emails THEN the system SHALL provide options to mark emails as "important" or "not important"
2. WHEN a user marks emails as important THEN the system SHALL store these preferences as training data
3. WHEN sufficient training data is available THEN the system SHALL use this data to train the LLM on user preferences
4. WHEN training data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide more examples
5. WHEN user preferences change THEN the system SHALL allow retraining with updated examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM to automatically filter my emails based on importance, so that I only see emails that matter to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM has been trained THEN the system SHALL automatically classify all indexed emails as important or not important
2. WHEN displaying emails THEN the system SHALL show only emails classified as important by default
3. WHEN a user wants to see all emails THEN the system SHALL provide an option to view unfiltered results
4. WHEN the LLM classifies emails THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for each classification
5. WHEN classification confidence is low THEN the system SHALL flag emails for manual review

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and browse my important emails efficiently, so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the email interface THEN the system SHALL display important emails in chronological order by default
2. WHEN searching emails THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search across all indexed email content
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and show relevance scores
4. WHEN browsing emails THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date range, sender, and importance level
5. WHEN viewing an email THEN the system SHALL display all original metadata and allow users to correct importance classification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email provider APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue indexing operations for retry
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction integrity and rollback incomplete operations
3. WHEN LLM services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to showing all emails with a notification
4. WHEN user authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without losing user data
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
